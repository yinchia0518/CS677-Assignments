    * Investigate “best” combination of hyper-parameters for two different investment strategies.<br /> 
  1. Moving Average Strategy --> Moving averages are important trading signals on their own, or when two averages cross over.   A rising moving average indicates that the security is in an uptrend, while a declining moving average indicates that it is   in a downtrend. Similarly, upward momentum is confirmed with a bullish crossover, which occurs when a short-term moving       average crosses above a longer-term moving average. Downward momentum is confirmed with a bearish crossover, which occurs     when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average.
  2. Bollinger Band Strategy --> Bollinger Bands, designate the upper and lower bands as price targets. If the price deflects   off the lower band and crosses above the 20-day average (the middle line), the upper band comes to represent the upper price   target. In a strong uptrend, prices usually fluctuate between the upper band and the 20-day moving average. When that         happens, a crossing below the 20-day moving average warns of a trend reversal to the downside.
