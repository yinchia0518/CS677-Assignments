# CS677-Assignments
- Assignment 1 : 
    * Description data analysis: What does your data look like? Need to reshape? merge? slice? aggregate?  sort? slice? aggregate? etc.  <br />
- Assignemnt 2 : 
    * Investigate “best” combination of hyper-parameters for two different investment strategies.<br /> 
        * Moving Average Strategy 
        * Bollinger Band Strategy 
    * How's the investment performace if you miss some good days and bad days? Which affect the result more? <br />
- Assignemnt 3 : 
    * How's the investment performace if you combine above strategies with ensemble voting <br />
    * Are last digits distributed evenly (10% end on digit 1, 10% on digits) or not? What digits are the most frequent? Least       frequent? <br />
- Assignemnt 4 : 
    * Is daily returns a normal distribution? Test it with 95% confidence interval.<br />
    * How does naïve strategy compare with the other strategies you considered before? <br />
- Assignemnt 5 : 
    * Label the dataset by assigning (+) if next day return is positive (or zero) and (-) if next day return is negative <br/>
    * Visulaize the labels with colors <br />
    * Compute error rate using different definitions <br />
    * Compute distance between actual labels and predicted labels using Euclidean method and Manhattan method <br />
    * visulize the distances according to different attributes for each method <br />
- Assignemnt 6 : 
    * KNN: Predicted label by K nearest neighbor classification & compute misclassification rate & visualize rates in terms of         different ks <br />
    * Naïve method: Predicted label by naïve prediction & compute misclassification rate <br />
    * Linear regression: Predicted label by linear regression of daily returns over the previous 30 days & visualize rthe           labels & compute misclassification rate  <br />
- Assignemnt 7 : 
    * Perceptron: Classify labels using perceptron <br />
    * Adaline: Compare error rate with different learning rate <br />
- Assignemnt 8 : 
    * Linear regression: Predicted your data's label using S&P500 return & Calculate MSE(Mean Square Error) <br />
    * Create an investment portfolio X1, X2 with a weighted average & plot the graph (return, volatility) for each combination       of weights <br />
- Assignemnt 9 : 
    * Think of three possible predictors that can affect labels <br />
    * Logistic regression: Use logistic regression to predict labels using this three factors <br />
    * Generate classification report <br />
- Assignemnt 10 : 
    * Apply k-means to split your data into k clusters <br />
    * Viusualzie labels for each clusters<br />
- Assignemnt 11 : 
   * Naïve Bayesian Classification: Use Use GaussianNB() to predict the labels<br />
- Assignemnt 12 : 
   * Decision tree: Use DT to predict the labels<br />
   * Support vector machines-Linear: Use SVN_Linear to predict the labels<br />
   * Summary: Compare the prediction accuracy for each algorithms above. Include Logistic Regression,KNN,Naïve Bayesian, K          means, Linear Regression,Decision Tree, SVM_Linear, SVM_RBF, Naïve, Moving Average and Bollinger Band<br />
